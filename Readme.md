# Statistical Inference

Statistical inference is a pivotal process within data analysis, enabling the extraction of insights and conclusions about populations or processes that extend beyond the scope of existing data.

### Selected Modules

Within this repository, you'll explore a comprehensive set of modules, each delving into various facets of statistical inference, and equipped with valuable insights and hands-on practice:

- **Basic Statistical Inference ([Explore](./Basic%20SI/))**: This foundational module dissects the bedrock of statistical inference, encompassing topics like the Central Limit Theorem, Confidence Intervals, simulations, and hypothesis testing. For more details, refer to the [Basic SI Readme](./Basic%20SI/Readme.md).

- **Bootstrapping and Regression ([Discover](./Bootstrapping%20and%20Regression/))**: In this section, you'll delve into bootstrapping techniques, the intricacies of fitting linear regression models, conducting multiple linear regression, and exploring logistic regression within the R environment. Explore further in the [Bootstrapping and Regression Readme](./Bootstrapping%20and%20Regression/Readme.md).
