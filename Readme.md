# Statistical Inference

Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to draw conclusions about a population or process beyond the existing data.

- [Basic SI](./Basic%20SI/): The folder contains the foundations for statistical inference are examined including Central Limit Theorem, Confidence Interval, simulations and hypothesis testing. More information is available on [Basic SI Readme](./Basic%20SI/Readme.md).

- [Bootstrapping and Regression](./Bootstrapping%20and%20Regression/): The folder's focus is to explore bootstrapping, fitting linear regression models, performing multiple linear regression, and logistic regression in R. More information is available on [Bootstrapping and Regression Readme](./Bootstrapping%20and%20Regression/Readme.md).

- [Concepts and Features of R](./Concepts%20and%20Features%20of%20R/): The folder containes some basic concepts and features of R language. Throughout this, tiny tips and clues about each of the topic will be learned. Further information is available on [Concepts and Features of R Readme](./Concepts%20and%20Features%20of%20R/).

- [Data Visualization](./Data%20Visualization/): The folder's focus is on how data visualization is done in R. A variety of charts and plots will be examined in plot and will be discussed. Pay attention to the legends, scales, labels, etc. and try to plot each chart in the requested format. Additional information is available on [Data Visualization Readme](./Data%20Visualization/Readme.md).

- [Project](./Project/): It is a useful project to deal with statistical inference concepts in R. Further information is available on [Project Readme](./Project/Readme.md).

- [Stanford Stats](./Stanford%20Stats%20Notebooks/): This folder contains the main lecture notebooks and assignments of Stanford Stats course. Detail information is available on [Stanford Stats Readme](./Stanford%20Stats%20Notebooks/Readme.md).
