## Data Visualization in R

The focus is on how data visualization is done in R. A variety of charts and plots will be examined in plot and will be discussed. Pay attention to the legends, scales, labels, etc. and try to plot each chart in the requested format.

#### Simple Plots
    - Plot the standard Normal distribution within the range [-3, 3]
    - Plot standard Normal distribution using samples pulled from this distribution
    - Plot Student’s t distribution with various degrees of freedom

#### QQ-Plots, Histograms, Box-Plots and Pie-Charts
    - Plot the quantiles of a dataset against the standard normal distribution
    - Draw histograms with different bins
    - Fit a smooth curve over the histogram
    - Plot the boxplot of dataset, discuss the skewness of this distribution.
    - Extract values of whiskers
    - Categorize the variable and Plot a pie chart that visualizes frequency of the categories

#### ggplot2
“ggplot2” is a plotting system for R based on the “Grammar of Graphics”. Grammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization, which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers.
    - Scatterplot, Plot a smooth graph (with its shadowed margin)

#### ggmap
“ggmap” is a collection of functions to visualize spatial data and models on top of static maps from various online sources (e.g. Google Maps and Stamen Maps). It includes tools common to those tasks, including functions for geolocation and routing. “ggmap” is based on “ggplot2” principles and conventions, so it can be used easily in the concept of graphics layers.
