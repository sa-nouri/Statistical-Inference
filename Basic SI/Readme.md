## Basic SI

The foundations for statistical inference are examined including Central Limit Theorem, Confidence Interval, simulations and hypothesis testing.

#### Central Limit Theorem
The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event.
    - Plot poisson distribution and examine the skewness of it
    - Get samples, and plot histogram and discuss the similarity of the sample distributions
    - Test the similarity of the sampling distribution with both the population distribution and the Normal distribution
    - Compare the estimated values of the mean and standard deviation of the population with the true statistics of the population.

#### Confidence Intervals
    - Form a alpha% confidence interval for the samples, and calculate meand and standard deviation
    - Satisfying of confidence interval formation

#### Simple Simulations
In a simulation, you set the ground rules of a random process and then the computer uses random numbers to generate an outcome that adheres to those rules.
    - Simulate rolling a fair dice and plot the distribution

#### Hypothesis Testing
    - Form the hypothesis test framework, check the conditions, specify the null and alternative clauses and find the p-value
